 Assignment 1: CHECK
 
 Assignment 2: CHECK
 error: euler integrator is incorrect
 comment: why is euler integrator stable?
 error: velocity verlet integrator gains energy
 comment: control torque, not time, should not be used in equation of motion
 regrade: can we debug assignment and discuss concepts during office hours?
 error: euler integrator is incorrect
 comment: double check each variable and its use in time
 error: velocity verlet integrator gains energy
 comment: control torque, not time, should not be used in equation of motion
 regrade2: euler integrator is unstable
 regrade3: working, but controller drives system to immediate instability
 
 Assignment 3: CANCELLED
 
 Assignment 4: CHECK
 error: branch not found
 regrade: public test crawler produces error (browser crash)
 regrade2: working
 
 Assignment 5: CHECK
 error: branch not found
 regrade: PD controller does not move to appropriate motion desireds
 regrade: working from Assignment-6 branch
 
 Assignment 6: CHECK
 error: branch not found
 regrade: working
 
 Assignment 7: DUE
 error: branch not found
 regrade: planner does not provide motion path solution within time bound
 error: failure on public test with s world
 comment: randomization does not sufficiently sample configuration space
 comment: functions extend and connect does not adhere to rrt-connect algorithm such that trees do not properly connect viable valid paths
